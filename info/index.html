			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Why bother mapping station carparks?. The answer is pretty simple (to me anyway).</p>
			<p>Carparks and other facilities for cars are one of the most damaging attributes of modern cities. The amount of valuable space dedicated to storing, driving or maintaining cars is astronomical and has massive opportunity costs. And that's leaving aside all of the issues with <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/cities-for-healthier-lives">public health</a>, <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/">safety</a> and other negative impacts.</p>
			<p>For parking specifically, there is a small but growing body of good literature out there that explains these negative impacts far better than I ever could. If you're interested in finding out more, I can highly recommend:
				<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.shoupdogg.com/">Anything by Donald Shoup</a> (especially the 'High Cost of Free Parking' book)</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/">Reinventing Parking blog</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/parking-is-hell-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">Freakonomics 'Parking is Hell' podcast</a></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>At present, there is hardly anything out there about carparks at railway stations in Melbourne, despite their prevalence in the local media.</p>
			<p>Even a cursory glance at aerial images of some of the new stations in the middle and outer suburbs of Melbourne will reveal just how much space is taken up by carparks and associated infrastructure.</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1357.1589048152175!2d145.3441452677826!3d-38.03895820390696!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ad61a25d5771ae5%3A0x1d04567609f51810!2sBerwick+Station!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1479181599616" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>So after all of that, this map and the associated <a href="../data">data</a> are meant to help show the location and amount of car parking in metropolitan Melbourne. With a number of stations approaching almost 1,000 parking spaces apiece, maybe it's time to rethink how we use this valuable urban space.</p>

			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Take a look at the <a href="../">map</a> and you can see some interesting things going on.</p>
			<p>Probably the most striking thing is the almost complete absence of any significant carparks in inner Melbourne. <a href="http://osm.org/go/uG4F2NmYt--?m=&way=90962303">Footscray</a> seems to have the closest large carpark (i.e. over 100 spaces) to the CBD. Otherwise, stations within a 4-5 kilometre radius of the CBD have no or minimal carparking spots. The Sandringham Line shows this well, with no decidated carparks at any station closer to the city than <a href="http://osm.org/go/uG4D9G~hz?m=&way=229798932">Elsternwick</a> with its ugly multi-storey carpark adjacent to the station.<p>
			<p>One possible explanation for this is the presence of old railway stations in medium to high-density urban environments in the inner city. These were usually built before private cars existed and consequently did not have any carparks.</p>
			<p>All told, there are <strong>40,008 parking spaces</strong> dedicated to railway stations across metropolitan Melbourne.<p>
			<p>This figure does not include on-street parking, car parks at nearby facilities such as shopping centres, or any other areas available near railway stations. This is also data from 2014 and numbers have changed over the past two years.</p>
			<p>Taking the standard area of a parallel parking space in Victoria as 12.74 metres squared (as defined by the <a href="http://planningschemes.dpcd.vic.gov.au/schemes/vpps/52_06.pdf">Victorian Planning Scheme</a>, of all places), this comes to <strong>509,701.92 square metres</strong> of space dedicated to car parking at railway stations.</p>
			<p>As with the total number, this figure is only a rough calculation and does not include accessways, roads or other car-related infrastructure around stations. It also assumes that all spaces are parallel, which is obviously not the case.</p>
			<p>This number is almost certainly an underestimate of the total amount of space dedicated to carparking. Even so, this is a huge amount of space to give over to carparking, especially how ineffiecient they are at moving people.</p>
			<p>In any case, take a look at the raw data for yourself and see what other conclusions can be drawn.</p>
